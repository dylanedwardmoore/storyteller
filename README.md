# Storyteller

Welcome! I'll be updating this readme in the next few days to make it more informative as well as adding several additional features. In the meantime, I recommend following the example to set up your own story.

#### `npm run start:dev`

Starts the application in development using `nodemon` and `ts-node` to do hot reloading.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app at `build`, cleaning the folder first.

#### `npm run start`

Starts the app in production by first building the project with `npm run build`, and then executing the compiled JavaScript at `build/index.js`.
